## Course Overview

Welcome to **Natural Language Processing**! This course introduces students to the fundamental concepts, algorithms, and techniques for processing and understanding human language using computational methods. Students will learn both classical and modern approaches to NLP, with a focus on practical applications and state-of-the-art deep learning methods.

### What You Will Learn

- **Text Processing & Representation**: Learn tokenization, word embeddings, and text vectorization techniques
- **Language Models**: Understand N-gram models, neural language models, and transformer architectures
- **Sequence Modeling**: Study RNNs, LSTMs, and attention mechanisms for sequence-to-sequence tasks
- **NLP Applications**: Explore sentiment analysis, named entity recognition, machine translation, and question answering
- **Modern NLP**: Work with pre-trained models like BERT, GPT, and other large language models
- **Practical Implementation**: Hands-on experience with popular NLP libraries and frameworks

### Course Format

- **Lectures**: Weekly lectures covering theoretical foundations and algorithmic approaches
- **Labs**: Hands-on sessions implementing NLP algorithms and working with real datasets
- **Assignments**: Programming assignments applying NLP techniques to practical problems
- **Project**: A final project where students build and evaluate an NLP system

### Prerequisites

- Basic understanding of machine learning concepts
- Programming experience in Python
- Familiarity with linear algebra and probability
- Experience with deep learning frameworks (PyTorch or TensorFlow) is helpful but not required
