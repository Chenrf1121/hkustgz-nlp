title: Lecture 2 - Fairness and Bias in AI
tldr: "Understanding fairness, bias, and discriminatioThis lecture moves beyond treating AI as a 'black box' by exploring methods to explain model decisions. It contrasts the transparency of simple models with the complexity of deep learning, focusing on how we can visualize and interpret what neural networks actually 'see'."
