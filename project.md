## Final Team Research Project

The final team research project is a significant component of this course (35% of final grade), providing an opportunity to apply NLP concepts and techniques to a research problem of your choice.

### Team Requirements

- **Team Size**: Teams must consist of **2-3 members**
- **Individual submissions will NOT be accepted**
- If you are having trouble finding teammates, the instructor and TAs will assign you to a team
- **Team Registration**: Due on **March 18, 2026**

### Project Components

The final research project grade includes:

1. **Team Registration (2%)**: Topic selection and team formation
2. **Poster Presentation (10%)**: Present your work during the poster session on **May 11, 2026**
3. **Final Report (10%)**: Technical report describing your research
4. **Code Quality (15%)**: Implementation quality and documentation
5. **Team Interview**: 10-minute interview with TA regarding codes and experimental results on **May 19, 2026**

### Important Dates

| Date | Milestone |
|------|-----------|
| March 11, 2026 | Final research project released |
| March 18, 2026 | Topic selection and team registration |
| May 11, 2026 | Poster presentation |
| May 18, 2026 | Final project code and report due |
| May 19, 2026 | Team interview with TA |

### Poster Presentation Rubrics

Your poster presentation will be evaluated on the following criteria (scored 1-7):

- **Introduction to the Topic**: Clear motivation and problem statement
- **Organization and Logic**: Well-structured presentation flow
- **Clarity of Presentation**: Clear explanation of methods and results
- **Fluency of Presentation**: Professional delivery and communication

**Scoring Scale**: 1 (Poor) | 2 (Below Average) | 3 (Borderline) | 4 (Up Average) | 5 (Good) | 6 (Very Good) | 7 (Excellent)

### Final Report Rubrics

#### Content Quality (60 points)

**Fundamental Concept Understanding (25 points)**
- Clearly explains key NLP concepts with well-structured definitions and real-world examples (22-25 points)
- Covers key NLP topics but lacks depth or fails to provide concrete examples (17-21 points)
- Mentions concepts but with vague explanations or missing critical details (10-16 points)
- Displays little to no understanding of core NLP concepts or applications (0-9 points)

**Review and Analyze Existing Research (20 points)**
- Provides a comprehensive literature review with relevant and up-to-date papers, critically analyzing methodologies and findings in NLP (18-20 points)
- Covers related works but lacks deep comparison or critical evaluation (14-17 points)
- Lists some related works without much discussion or relevance (8-13 points)
- Little to no research cited, or references are outdated/irrelevant (0-7 points)

**Practical Application & Critical Analysis (15 points)**
- Demonstrates strong analytical skills by applying NLP concepts to real-world scenarios with insightful evaluation and innovative solutions (13-15 points)
- Provides relevant applications and some critical analysis but lacks depth, originality, or a strong connection to practical challenges (10-12 points)
- Mentions basic applications but offers superficial analysis, with limited critical thinking or weak real-world relevance (6-9 points)
- Shows little to no application of concepts, with unclear, incorrect, or missing critical analysis (0-5 points)

#### Expression and Format (40 points)

**Language Expression (15 points)**
- Clear and fluent language expression, easy to understand (13-15 points)
- Generally good expression, but some parts are not fluent (10-12 points)
- Unclear expression, affects understanding (6-9 points)
- Severely unclear expression (0-5 points)

**Format Adherence (15 points)**
- Strictly follows format requirements, well-structured (13-15 points)
- Basically follows format requirements, with minor deviations (10-12 points)
- Insufficient format adherence, noticeable deviations (6-9 points)
- Fails to follow format requirements (0-5 points)

**References (10 points)**
- Appropriately selected references, correct citation format (9-10 points)
- Generally appropriate references, minor issues in format or selection (7-8 points)
- Inadequate references or incorrect citation format (4-6 points)
- Severely lacking references or improper format (0-3 points)

### Code Quality Rubrics

Your code will be evaluated on three main criteria (100 points total):

**Specifications (50 points)**
- The code works and produces the correct results and displays them correctly. This code meets all of the specifications (40-50 points)
- The code works and produces the correct results and displays them correctly. It also meets most of the other specifications (30-39 points)
- The program produces correct results but does not display them correctly (15-29 points)
- The code is producing incorrect results (0-14 points)

**Readability (30 points)**
- The code is exceptionally well organized and very easy to follow (25-30 points)
- The code is fairly easy to read (20-24 points)
- The code is readable only by someone who knows what it is supposed to be doing (10-19 points)
- The code is poorly organized and very difficult to read (0-9 points)

**Efficiency (20 points)**
- The code is extremely efficient without sacrificing readability and understanding (15-20 points)
- The code is fairly efficient without sacrificing readability and understanding (10-14 points)
- The code is brute force and unnecessarily long (6-9 points)
- The code is huge and appears to be patched together (0-5 points)

### Technical Requirements

- All projects must be implemented in **PyTorch**
- No other programming languages (R, Matlab, Java, C++) or deep learning frameworks (TensorFlow) will be accepted
- You will have access to the Diandong platform for computing resources
- Detailed video tutorials will be provided for using the platform
